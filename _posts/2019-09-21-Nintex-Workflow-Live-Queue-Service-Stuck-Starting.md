# Issues Starting Nintex Live Workflow Queue Service

So this is where I had one server in an on prem farm that
I could get the service in question started but every
morning i would find it in an error state.

So the every morning bit made sense as there is a daily timer job
to recycle this service as for the what to do read on...

You will probably find it documented or advised in the Nintex forums
to delete a provisioning timer job that instantiates the service
